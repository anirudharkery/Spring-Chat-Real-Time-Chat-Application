# Spring Chat: Real-Time Chat Application

Spring Chat is a robust, scalable real-time chat application built with Java and Spring Boot, leveraging the power of WebSockets for instant message delivery. This project demonstrates how to create a high-performance, bi-directional communication system using modern Java technologies.

## Key Features:
- Real-time messaging using WebSockets
- User authentication and authorization
- Group chat functionality
- Private messaging between users
- Message persistence using a database
- Typing indicators
- Online/offline status updates
- Scalable architecture for handling multiple concurrent connections

## Technologies Used:
- Java 11+
- Spring Boot 2.x
- Spring WebSocket
- Spring Security for authentication
- Maven for dependency management and build automation
- STOMP (Simple Text Orientated Messaging Protocol) over WebSockets
- JPA (Java Persistence API) for database operations
- RESTful API for user management and chat history

## Architecture Highlights:
- Utilizes Spring Boot's auto-configuration for rapid development
- WebSocket handlers for managing real-time connections
- STOMP message brokers for efficient message routing
- JPA repositories for data persistence
- RESTful controllers for HTTP-based operations

Spring Chat showcases the power of WebSockets in creating responsive, real-time applications within the Spring ecosystem. The application's architecture ensures low-latency message delivery while maintaining scalability for a large number of concurrent users.

This project serves as an excellent starting point for developers looking to understand WebSocket implementation in a Spring Boot environment or those seeking to build their own real-time communication platforms.

Whether you're building a customer support system, a collaborative tool, or a social platform, Spring Chat provides a solid foundation for real-time messaging capabilities in your Java applications.
